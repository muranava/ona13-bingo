        <p><a href="http://ona13.journalists.org/">#ONA13</a> has come and gone, so it's time to take a look at the analytics for this year's bingo game and otherwise talk about it a bit.</p>
        <h3>The beginning</h3>
        <p>I put the game together with <a href="http://backbonejs.org/">Backbone</a> on Thursday after a Wednesday-night brainstorming session at <a href="http://www.highvelocityatlanta.com/">High Velocity</a> with <a href="http://twitter.com/juliajrh">my wife</a> and some of <a href="http://twitter.com/elizabeth_shell">my</a> <a href="http://twitter.com/gteresa">former</a> <a href="http://twitter.com/newshour">NewsHour</a> <a href="http://twitter.com/cshalby">colleagues</a>, who suggested most of the words in the game.</p>
        <p>It's my first time hosting a finished project on <a href="http://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a>, but it went pretty well from my end. Right before announcing the game to the world (or at least to the conference hashtag), I added the usual <a href="http://www.google.com/analytics/">Google Analytics</a> tracking code and some event tracking to get a feel for what people were doing with the game&mdash;hence this post!</p>
        <h3>Visitors</h3>
        <p>From Thursday through Sunday (9 p.m. EDT), there were <strong>116 unique visitors</strong>, two of whom had their browsers set to request the page in Norwegian.</p>
        <p>More than <strong>45 percent</strong> used <a href="https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/browser/">Chrome</a>, with the bulk of the rest using <a href="http://www.apple.com/safari/">Safari</a> both on the desktop and on iOS. There were only two visitors using <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/internet-explorer/download-ie" title="Internet Explorer">IE</a>!</p>
        <p>There were slightly more visits from mobile devices (about <strong>55 percent</strong>) than from laptops. About <strong>75 percent</strong> of those were on iOS.</p>
        <h3>Winners</h3>
        <p>There were <strong>17</strong> recorded winners, although only two people tweeted that they won using the <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23onabingo&amp;f=realtime">#ONAbingo</a> hashtag.</p>
        <h3>Words</h3>
        <p>The three most commonly checked words (i.e., those marked by players as having been heard) were:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Infographics (24 times)</li>
          <li>Engagement (21 times)</li>
          <li>Storytelling (18 times)</li>
        </ol>
        <p>In fourth was a four-way tie between "audience", "<abbr title="Freedom of Information Act">FOIA</abbr>", "Knight Foundation" and "social", with 17 occurrences each.</p>
        <h3>Thoughts</h3>
        <p>Putting the game together was a lot of fun, as was tracking its progress. It's the sort of thing that probably would have done better had it been built and promoted ahead of time, but I'm still happy with it. The game is <a href="http://github.com/myersjustinc/ona13-bingo">open source</a> (<a href="https://github.com/myersjustinc/ona13-bingo/blob/master/LICENSE.md">BSD license</a>), so anyone's free to use the code again for next year!</p>
